        <p>I was born to Howard Anthony Stark and Maria Collins Carbonell Stark, owners of the prominent US firm, Stark Industries.
        As a boy, I was fascinated with building and controlling machines.</p>
        <br>
        <p>At the age of 15 I've entered the undergraduate electrical engineering program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and graduated with two masterâ€™s degrees by the age of 19.
        Went to work for Stark Industries, but showed more interest in living a reckless playboy lifestyle than using my engineering skills.
        At the age of 21, inherited Stark Enterprises when my parents were killed in a car accident secretly orchestrated by rival corporation Republic Oil (later ROXXON).
        Still lacking in business acumen, promoted secretary Virginia "Pepper" Potts to be my executive assistant and left the majority of my workload on her to avoid unneeded burdens. </p>
        <br>
        <p>I am an eccentric self-described genius, billionaire, playboy and philanthropist and the former head of Stark Industries. Using my own great wealth and exceptional technical knowledge, 
            I enjoyed the playboy lifestyle for many years until I was kidnapped by the Ten Rings. With my life on the line, I created an armored suit which he used to escape my captors, returning home and becoming the armored superhero known as Iron Man, battling against terrorists as well as my own former business partner Obadiah Stane. I enjoyed the fame that came with my new secret identity and decided to share it with the world, publicly announcing myself as Iron Man.</p>
